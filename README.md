Currently working on recreating a banking system from scratch in C. The goal of this project is for me to improve my coding ability in C. Iplan to eventually have a client-server model where users can run the client executable and connect to the "bank server", all of this through TCP/IP. I am also very interested in understanding the underlying logic of databases, which brought me to creating my own very basic sqlite database from scrach.

Very short readme for now, will add things as I progress !
